I've been working on a fun deck for Twitch chat that allows people to give a user a mystery candy using !givecandy and for the given user to unwrap the mystery candy using !eatcandy

Also inside the deck is a button for !trickortreat which when typed selects a trick or a treat and then informs the user what they got! The treats are a random candy and the tricks are quirky little messages about various monsters with 95% chance of getting those or a 5% chance of being timed out for 1 minute (unless you're mod or VIP)! (a real trick hehe) 

I've included the deck JSON and a folder containing some images and a sound that you can use the deck button in there to make a scene on your OBS for a little fun alert (entirely optional)

I've put comments throughout the buttons within the deck, even an entire button that has explanations for the deck in the comments. So you can customise this to your needs or use as is
